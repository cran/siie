\item{group}{The group avariable. In the context of our paper,

\examples{

 set.seed(19960822)
 nr_of_rows = 1e4
 data.frame(
   Id = 1:1e4,
   Journal = sample(LETTERS,nr_of_rows,replace = TRUE),
   CiteCount = sample(1:100,nr_of_rows,replace = TRUE)
 ) -> journal_table

 prp(journal_table,group = "Journal",index = "CiteCount")
